# Customer Segmentation :busts_in_silhouette: :bar_chart:

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation repository! This project is all about identifying different segments within a bank's existing customer base. We do this by analyzing their spending patterns and past interactions with the bank. :money_with_wings: :bank:

## Problem Statement :question:

AllLife Bank wants to focus on its credit card customer base in the next financial year. The bank's marketing research team has advised that market penetration can be improved. The Marketing team plans to run personalized campaigns to target new customers and upsell to existing ones. :credit_card: :dart:

Another insight was that customers perceive the bank's support services poorly. So, the Operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model to ensure faster resolution of customer queries. :hourglass_flowing_sand: :rocket:

## Objective :dart:

Our objective is to identify different segments in the existing customer base. We do this based on their spending patterns and past interaction with the bank. :mag_right: :bank:

## Data :bar_chart:

We use data from various bank customers, including their credit limit, the total number of credit cards they have, and different channels they've used to contact the bank for any queries. These channels include visiting the bank, online, and through a call centre. :telephone_receiver: :computer: :bank:
